# UCM_CatTracks_Simulator

Python simulation of student wait times for the University of California at Merced's CatTracks bus system

UC Merced, one of the newest University of California campuses, began accepting undergraduate students in Fall 2005. Recently, their bus transit system, CatTracks, is experiencing a number of capacity issues. Students are complaining about the wait and travel times to get to campus. A recurring issue is that the bus would fill up from all of the previous stops before arriving to campus.

I am building a model to simulate student wait times at the various bus stops offered by UCM's CatTracks system using a combination of Python programming, pandas, matplotlib and bash scripting. Data is primarily located in two spreadsheets containing ridership information from February 2019 and October 2018. Data from February 2019 and October 2018 were selected since they are one of the few months during the school session not affected by holidays. 

Each of these spreadsheets contain data on more than 12 bus lines on separate worksheets, but for the purposes of this project, capacity and wait times will only be simulated for three bus lines. These lines were selected based on number of stops, weekday operation to cater to student need to take the bus to attend classes, and these bus lines being the ones students have expressed issues about.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to simulate student wait times for the University of California at Merced's CatTracks bus system.

UC Merced, one of the newest University of California campuses in the San Joaqui Valley, began accepting undergraduate students in Fall 2005. Recently, their bus transit system, CatTracks, is experiencing a number of capacity issues. Students are expressing frustration about the wait and travel times to get to campus. This project attempts to simulate the impact of student load on these wait times.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
